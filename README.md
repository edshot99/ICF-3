# Improved Combat Framework
> A fork of ACF, which is a standardized combat and damage addon for Garry's Mod

Discord : None currently

Improved Combat Framework (ICF) is a fork of Armored Combat Framework (ACF), which aims to rebalance and redesign the addon as a whole. It was created by the IMR Buildergroup, to have both a more unique experience to the original ACF3, while allowing forward and backward compatibility.

Ammunition is customizable with varying ballistic performance along with armor being customizable for protection against various threats. ICF is intended to be balanced for both sandbox and competetive use, to still allow various vehicle designs and to establish a field to fight on.

## Installation

### Dependencies
    ICF Requires these to work

Wiremod ([Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=160250458) or [Github](https://github.com/wiremod))
Contraption Framework ([Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3154971187) or [Github](https://github.com/ACF-Team/CFW))

Prop Protection with [CPPI](http://ulyssesmod.net/archive/CPPI_v1-3.pdf) is not required, but highly recommended. We'd recommend Nadmod PP ([Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=159298542) or [Github](https://github.com/Nebual/NadmodPP)).

ICF works best when used with primitives, thin plate models and SProps ([Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=173482196)), as they provide a more complete selection over the vanilla PHX plates.


### Git Client (Recommended)

Install a Git client, such as the [Github client](https://desktop.github.com/) or [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/), then clone ICF to your addons folder. With the Github client installed you can click the green button at the top of the ICF repo page and select clone. Updating ICF on your server or client after install simply requires clicking the pull button in your respective Git client.

### Manually

1. Click the green button at the top of the ICF repo and select zip.
2. Extract the ICF folder.
3. Inside you will find another ICF folder.
4. Move the inner ICF folder to `garrysmod/garrysmod/addons`
