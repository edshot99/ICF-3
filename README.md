Improved Combat Framework (ICF) is a combat framework addon Garry's Mod, which is a fork of the already existing Armored Combat Framework (ACF). ICF was created by a buildergroup within the ACF-3 community, due to disagreements with the development direction of the addon. It rebalances a majority of ACF's components, and allows the builder to interact with the addon in more variable ways.

Ammunition is customizable with varying ballistic performance along with armor being customizable for protection against various threats. ICF is intended to be balanced for both sandbox and comptetetive purposes, so you can build vastly different vehicles without being restricted in design choices.

## Installation

### Dependencies
    ICF Requires these to work

Wiremod ([Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=160250458) or [Github](https://github.com/wiremod))
Contraption Framework ([Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3154971187) or [Github](https://github.com/ACF-Team/CFW))

Prop Protection with [CPPI](http://ulyssesmod.net/archive/CPPI_v1-3.pdf) is not required, but highly recommended. We'd recommend Nadmod PP ([Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=159298542) or [Github](https://github.com/Nebual/NadmodPP)).

ICF works best when used with primitives, thin plate models and SProps ([Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=173482196)), as these provide a more complete selection over the vanilla PHX plates.


### Git Client (Recommended)

Install a Git client, such as the [Github client](https://desktop.github.com/) or [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/), then clone ICF to your addons folder. With the Github client installed you can click the green button at the top of the ICF repo page and select clone. Updating ICF on your server or client after install simply requires clicking the pull button in your respective Git client.

### Manually

1. Click the green button at the top of the ICF repo and select zip.
2. Extract the ICF folder.
3. Inside you will find another ICF folder.
4. Move the inner ICF folder to `garrysmod/garrysmod/addons`
